I recently built my profile and I wanted to embed a resume generator that converts structured data into a clean PDF resume. The idea came from wanting to maintain my resume as code - something I could version control, easily update, and generate consistently formatted PDFs from.

## The Problem

Managing resumes is a pain. You have different versions for different roles, formatting gets messed up when you convert between file types, and keeping everything consistent across updates is tedious. I wanted something that would let me maintain my resume data in a structured format and generate professional PDFs on demand.

## The Setup

I went with Next.js as I am using that for my profile

- **React PDF** - For generating PDFs from React components
- **TypeScript** - For type safety across the data structure
- **Tailwind + Shadcn** - For any web components (though the PDF uses its own styling)

The core idea is simple: define your resume data once in a structured format, then render it as a PDF using React components.

## Data Structure

I started by defining a clear data structure for resume content:

```ts
export interface ResumeData {
  personalInfo: {
    name: string;
    location: string;
    email: string;
    linkedin: string;
    github: string;
    website: string;
  };
  technologies: {
    languages: string;
    softwareAndFrameworks: string;
  };
  aboutMe: string;
  projects: Project[];
  experience: Experience[];
  education: Education[];
  achievements: Achievement[];
  certifications: Certification[];
}
```

I use `content-collections` to manage data and the types and data is fetched from there. Everything stays in sync because it's all referencing the same source data.

## PDF Generation

The PDF generation happens through a Next.js API route at `/resume`. When you hit this endpoint, it renders a React PDF document and returns the binary data:

```ts
export async function GET() {
  const buffer = await renderToBuffer(Resume());

  return new NextResponse(buffer, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/pdf",
      "Content-Disposition": "inline; filename=resume.pdf",
      "Content-Length": buffer.length.toString(),
    },
  });
}
```

The `Resume` component is where the magic happens. It's a React PDF document that renders each section:

```typescript
export function Resume() {
  return (
    <Document title="Bismit Panda's Resume" author="Bismit Panda" subject="Resume">
      <Page size="LETTER" style={styles.page}>
        <HeaderSection data={resumeData.personalInfo} />
        <AboutMeSection content={resumeData.aboutMe} />
        <ProjectsSection projects={resumeData.projects} />
        <ExperienceSection experience={resumeData.experience} />
        <TechnologiesSection technologies={resumeData.technologies} />
        <EducationSection education={resumeData.education} />
        <AchievementsSection achievements={resumeData.achievements} />
        <CertificationsSection certifications={resumeData.certifications} />
      </Page>
    </Document>
  );
}
```

## Component Structure

Each section is its own component. Here's how the experience section works:

```typescript
export function ExperienceSection({ experience }: { experience: Experience[] }) {
  return (
    <View style={styles.section}>
      <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Experience</Text>
      {experience.map((exp, index) => (
        <View key={index} style={styles.entryContainer}>
          <View style={styles.entryHeader}>
            <Text style={styles.entryTitle}>
              {exp.title}, {exp.company}
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.entryDate}>
              {formatDate(exp.startDate, "MMM yyyy")} -{" "}
              {exp.endDate ? formatDate(exp.endDate, "MMM yyyy") : "Present"}
            </Text>
          </View>
          <Text style={styles.paragraph}>{exp.description}</Text>
          <View style={styles.highlightsList}>
            {exp.highlights.map((highlight, highlightIndex) => (
              <View key={highlightIndex} style={styles.highlight}>
                <Text style={styles.bullet}>â€¢</Text>
                <Text style={styles.highlightText}>{highlight.trim()}.</Text>
              </View>
            ))}
          </View>
        </View>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

React PDF uses its own styling system that's similar to React Native. You define styles using `StyleSheet.create()` and apply them to components.

## Styling

Styling PDFs is different from web styling. I needed to use plain CSS-in-JS like styles.

Here's a snippet of the styles I used:

```ts
export const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: {
    fontFamily: "Helvetica",
    fontSize: 10,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    paddingTop: 25,
    paddingBottom: 25,
    paddingLeft: 30,
    paddingRight: 30,
    backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
  },
  sectionTitle: {
    fontSize: 12,
    fontWeight: "bold",
    marginBottom: 6,
    paddingBottom: 1,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: "#000000",
    borderBottomStyle: "solid",
  },
  // ... more styles
});
```

## How It Works

Using it is straightforward:

1. Update your resume data in `resume-data.ts`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/resume`
3. Your browser displays or downloads the generated PDF

The PDF generates fresh each time, so any data changes are immediately reflected.

## What I Learned

The biggest challenge was getting the layout right. React PDF's layout engine is powerful but different from CSS. Spending time understanding how flexbox works in this context saved me a lot of debugging later.

Data structure matters a lot. Having clean, typed interfaces made it easy to add new sections or modify existing ones without breaking anything.

PDF generation is surprisingly fast. Even with multiple sections and complex layouts, the generation happens almost instantly.

## Next Steps

This setup works great for my needs, but there are some obvious extensions which I may add later:

- **Multiple templates** - Different layouts for different job types
- **Web preview** - Show how the resume looks before generating the PDF
- **Dynamic sections** - Include/exclude sections based on the target role (e.g. if the user is applying for a frontend role, exclude the backend experience)
- **Better styling** - More sophisticated layouts and typography

The foundation is solid though. Having my resume as code means I can iterate quickly, keep everything in version control, and generate consistent PDFs whenever I need them.
