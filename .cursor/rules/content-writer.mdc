# Technical Blog Writing Guidelines

## Research Requirements

- **ALWAYS perform a comprehensive web search before writing any technical blog**
- Research current best practices, recent updates, and relevant documentation
- Verify technical accuracy of concepts, APIs, and implementations
- Check for recent changes or deprecations in technologies being discussed
- Gather real-world examples and use cases from authoritative sources
- Ensure information is up-to-date and reflects current state of the technology

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Use an **educational tone** with clear explanations
- Apply **adaptive technical depth**: explain concepts when needed, assume knowledge when appropriate
- Maintain a **conversational yet professional voice**
- Write for clarity and accessibility while maintaining technical accuracy
- Use active voice when possible
- Break down complex concepts into digestible sections

## Structure Requirements

- Use a **flexible structure** based on content needs
- **Always include** an introduction/context section that sets up the topic
- **Mention prerequisites/assumptions upfront** - clearly state what readers should know beforehand
- Include relevant sections as needed:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution overview
  - Implementation details
  - What I learned / Key takeaways
  - Next steps / Future improvements
  - Conclusion
- Organize content logically with clear headings (h2, h3, h4)
- Use transitions between sections for better flow

## Code Examples

- Provide a **balanced mix of code and explanations**
- Use filename annotations in code blocks: ` ```ts filename=path/to/file.ts `
- Highlight important lines when relevant using:
  - `// [!code highlight]` - highlights a line
  - `// [!code focus]` - focuses attention on a line
  - `// [!code ++]` - indicates added code
  - `// [!code --]` - indicates removed code
  - `// [!code error]` - marks an error
  - `// [!code warning]` - marks a warning
- Use `no-line-numbers` meta when appropriate: ` ```ts no-line-numbers `
- Always provide context before and after code snippets - explain what the code does
- Include complete, runnable examples when possible
- Use proper syntax highlighting for the language

## MDX Components Usage

### Callout
Use for tips, warnings, and important notes.

- **Variants**: `default`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
- **Icons**: Any lucide-react icon name (e.g., `info`, `circle-check-big`, `triangle-alert`, `skull`, `alert-circle`)
- **Example**: 
  ```mdx
  <Callout title="Note" icon="info" variant="info">
    This is an important note about the implementation.
  </Callout>
  ```

### FileTree
Use to show project structure when it adds value to understanding the codebase.

- **Props**: 
  - `tree` (array of File/Folder objects)
  - `defaultOpen` (boolean, optional)
- **Example**: 
  ```mdx
  <FileTree
    tree={[
      { type: "folder", name: "src", children: [
        { type: "file", name: "index.ts" }
      ]}
    ]}
    defaultOpen
  />
  ```

### Codeblock
Standard markdown code blocks with enhancements.

- **Special languages**:
  - `mermaid` - for diagrams and flowcharts
  - `shell` - for terminal commands with special formatting
  - `math` - for mathematical expressions
- **Shell tabs**: Use ` ```shell tabs=pnpm,npm,yarn separator=--- ` for multiple package manager examples
- **Filename**: Always include filename when showing file-specific code: ` ```ts filename=path/to/file.ts `
- **Line highlighting**: Use `// [!code highlight]` and other annotations as needed

### GithubLink
Link to GitHub profiles or repositories.

- **Example**: 
  ```mdx
  <GithubLink owner="bismitpanda" repo="portfolio-next" />
  ```
- Use for linking to relevant repositories or code examples

### Kbd
Display keyboard shortcuts with proper formatting.

- **Example**: 
  ```mdx
  Use <Kbd>Ctrl+Z</Kbd> or <Kbd>Cmd+Z</Kbd> to undo.
  ```
- Automatically converts common shortcuts to symbols (Cmd → ⌘, Ctrl → ^, etc.)

### EmbedBlog
Link to other blog posts with a styled link.

- **Example**: 
  ```mdx
  Check out this <EmbedBlog fileName="resume-generator.mdx" placeholder="blog post" /> for more details.
  ```

### Accordion
For collapsible content sections.

- Use `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, `AccordionContent` components
- Useful for FAQs, optional reading, or detailed explanations

### Tabs
For showing multiple code examples or content variations.

- Use `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` components
- Great for showing different implementations or multiple package manager commands

### Steps
For step-by-step instructions.

- Wrap step headings (h3) inside `<Steps>` component
- Automatically numbers steps for better readability

### Button
For interactive elements (use sparingly in blog content).

- Only use when interactivity adds value
- Prefer links for navigation

### LinkedCard
For card-style links to external resources.

- Use for prominent links to external documentation or resources

## MDX Formatting

### Frontmatter
Always include proper frontmatter at the start of every blog post:

```yaml
---
title: Blog Title
excerpt: Short description that appears in previews
date: YYYY-MM-DD
category: Category Name
image: /images/blogs/image.png
---
```

### Markdown Features
- Use proper markdown formatting (headings, lists, links, images, tables)
- Leverage custom components when appropriate
- Use standard markdown features:
  - Footnotes: `[^1]` and `[^1]: footnote text`
  - Task lists: `- [x] Completed` or `- [ ] Incomplete`
  - Strikethrough: `~~text~~`
  - Tables: Standard markdown table syntax
  - Blockquotes: `> quote text`

### Headings
- Use h2 for main sections
- Use h3 for subsections
- Use h4-h6 for deeper nesting when needed
- Headings automatically appear in table of contents

## Content Elements

- **Callouts**: Use for tips, warnings, and important notes
- **Diagrams/File Trees**: Include when they add value (optional but recommended for complex topics)
- **Links**: Include links to repositories/resources when relevant (optional but helpful)
- **Prerequisites**: Always mention what readers should know beforehand
- **Images**: Use images to illustrate concepts, show UI, or provide visual context
- **Code examples**: Balance between showing complete examples and focused snippets

## Quality Standards

- **Clear, actionable explanations**: Every section should provide value
- **Real-world examples and use cases**: Ground concepts in practical applications
- **Practical takeaways**: Readers should learn something actionable
- **Proper code syntax highlighting**: Use correct language tags
- **Accurate and up-to-date information**: Verify through web search before writing
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow established patterns in existing blog posts
- **Accessibility**: Use descriptive alt text for images, proper heading hierarchy
- **SEO considerations**: Use descriptive titles, excerpts, and proper heading structure

## Best Practices

1. **Start with context**: Help readers understand why they should care
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Use code examples and visual aids
3. **Address common pitfalls**: Mention what can go wrong and how to avoid it
4. **Provide complete examples**: When possible, show full working code
5. **Link to resources**: Help readers dive deeper with relevant links
6. **Test your code**: Ensure all code examples are accurate and tested
7. **Review for clarity**: Read through as if you're learning the topic for the first time
8. **Keep it focused**: Stay on topic and avoid unnecessary tangents
